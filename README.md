# Final Project Proposal
For my CSCI 135 final project I would like to do something similar to our earlier Purple America Lab. However, I would like to map census data detailing percentage of population in poverty in specific counties (And use a color gradeint to indicate this like in Purple America). Alongside I would like to output two seperate line graphs following national SNAP program enrollment and national poverty rate. Lastly I would like to use data from the year 1989-2015 and output each year as a sepearte frame of gif. I think this project is interesting because it allows me to easily visualize poverty rate in the US (with the curve and the map) and enrollment in a critical program (SNAP or Food Stamps as it is called) in tandem. This visualization will help me put into perspective possibly some correlation between the two. I am really intersted in Economics and especially social welfare and this will be a gnarly project to not only feel empowered by computer science but to do something I think will have lasting value.

## Data Plan
My sources of data are as follows, I will pull all my county level poverty data and national poverty data in csv files from census.gov. I will pull all my SNAP enrollment from fns.gov and use each point at each year to map points onto each "frame" of my gif.
The formatting of the map for my county poverty data is trickier than the Purple America lab, I will use each county's ID to determine its coordinate value (for mapping) and then map all points to my map.

## Implementation Plan
I am starting from semi-existing code, I will use a similar structure to the Purple America lab, but also like the gif lab that Bill linked me when we spoke about the project (from an earlier version of the class). I will most likely use recursion to build up my gifs from previous 'frames', object oriented programming similar to Purple America and imaging (similar to Purple America.
